# 🧩 PDF Tool (Python + PyPDF2)

A beginner-friendly desktop tool to **merge**, **encrypt**, and **decrypt** PDF files — built using **Python, PyPDF2, and Tkinter**.

---

## 📝 Problem Statement
When we download PDF statements from banks, they are usually **password-protected**.  
This becomes annoying because **we have to enter the password every time we open the file**.

**Goal:**  
Build a tool where users can:
- 🧩 Merge multiple PDF files into one
- 🔐 Encrypt PDFs with a password (if needed)
- 🔓 Decrypt PDFs (remove password protection permanently)

---

## ⚙️ Features
- 📂 Merge 2 or more PDF files into a single file
- 🔒 Encrypt any PDF with a custom password
- 🔓 Decrypt password-protected PDFs permanently by entering the password once
- 💻 Simple GUI (Tkinter) to make it beginner-friendly

---

## 💻 Tech Stack
- **Language:** Python
- **Library:** PyPDF2
- **GUI Framework:** Tkinter

---

## ⚡ My Contribution
- Wrote all the **core logic** (merge, encrypt, decrypt) myself
- Designed the **GUI layout** with the help of ChatGPT to make it clean and simple

> This project helped me understand how PDFs work internally, how to handle file I/O,  
> and how to use AI tools as coding partners.
